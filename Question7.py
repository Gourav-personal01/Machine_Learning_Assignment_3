# Q7. You are working on a project to predict the outcome of a soccer match. You have a large dataset with  many features, 
# including player statistics and team rankings. 
# Explain how you would use the Embedded  method to select the most relevant features for the model. 

# Answer - 
# Select a Machine Learning Algorithm: Choose a machine learning algorithm that is suitable for the problem. Common choices for predicting soccer match outcomes include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.
# Feature Importance from the Algorithm: Many machine learning algorithms inherently provide a way to measure feature importance during training. For example, decision trees and random forests calculate feature importances based on how much each feature contributes to reducing impurity or error.
# Train the Model: Train the chosen machine learning algorithm on the dataset, including all available features. The algorithm will take into account feature interactions and their contributions to the model's performance.
# Retrieve Feature Importance Scores: After training, retrieve the feature importance scores calculated by the algorithm. These scores indicate how much each feature contributed to the model's decision-making process.
# Rank and Select Features: Rank the features based on their importance scores. Features with higher scores are considered more relevant. You can then select the top N features that you want to include in the final model.
# Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using the selected features on a validation or test dataset. Evaluate relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC to measure how well the model predicts soccer match outcomes.
# Hyperparameter Tuning: Depending on the chosen algorithm, you might need to perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. This can involve adjusting parameters that influence feature selection and the overall model behavior.
# Interpret Results: Interpret the model's results to understand how the selected features contribute to predicting soccer match outcomes. This can provide insights into which player statistics, team rankings, or other factors are most influential in determining match results.
