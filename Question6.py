# Q6. In a telecom company, you are working on a project to develop a predictive model for customer churn.
# You are unsure of which features to include in the model because the dataset contains several different
# ones. Describe how you would choose the most pertinent attributes for the model using the Filter Method.


# Answer - 

# Understand the Problem: Clearly define the problem of customer churn prediction and understand the business context. This will help you identify which features are likely to be relevant.
# Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. This ensures that the feature evaluation is accurate.
# Feature Selection Criteria: Determine the criteria or metrics you will use to evaluate the relevance of each feature. Common criteria include correlation, variance, information gain, and statistical tests like chi-squared for categorical features.
# Calculate Feature Scores: Calculate the chosen metric for each feature with respect to the target variable (churn). For instance, calculate correlation coefficients, information gain, or other relevant scores.
# Rank Features: Rank the features based on their scores. Features with higher scores are considered more relevant.
# Set Threshold: Decide on a threshold value that determines which features to retain and which to discard. This can be a fixed value or based on a certain percentage of the highest-scoring features.
# Select Features: Select the top N features that meet or exceed the threshold. These are the features you'll include in the model.
# Validate and Test: Split the dataset into training and validation/test sets. Train your predictive model using only the selected features. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation/test set using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
# Iterate if Necessary: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you might consider experimenting with different threshold values or trying different feature selection criteria to find a combination that works best for your specific problem
# Interpret Results: Once you have a model with selected features, interpret the results to gain insights into which attributes are driving customer churn predictions. This can help in understanding the underlying patterns and making informed business decisions.
# Monitor and Update: Periodically re-evaluate the chosen features as the dataset or business context changes. Customer behavior and influencing factors might evolve over time.
